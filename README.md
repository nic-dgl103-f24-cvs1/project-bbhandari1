# Ambassador Transportation Website Redesign

## 1. Project Summary

### Website: [Ambassador Transportation](https://ambassadortransportation.net)

### Why a Redesign is Needed:

The current website is outdated, not mobile-friendly, and not providing an optimal user experience. The new site will enhance accessibility, speed, and the overall appearance, allowing customers to easily book transportation services.

### Primary Purpose:

To showcase Ambassador Transportation’s premium services and provide an intuitive platform for customers to book or inquire about transportation services online.

### Target Audience:

- **Individuals**: Seeking luxury transportation services (e.g., airport transfers, events, private tours).
- **Businesses**: Requiring corporate transport for employees, clients, and special occasions.
- **Event Planners**: Organizing transportation for wine tours and other events.

### Desired Action:

Visitors should be able to:

- Book transportation through clear calls-to-action.
- Request quotes or more information about services directly from the website.

### Issues with the Current Site:

- **Accessibility**: Does not comply with modern web standards.
- **Speed**: Slow load times.
- **Design**: Outdated, not visually appealing.
- **Responsiveness**: Poor mobile experience.

## 2. Look and Feel

### Mood:

- **Sophisticated and Inviting** with a touch of **Luxurious Comfort**.

### Inspiration:

1. [Transdev](https://www.transdev.com) - Professional, clean, and organized design.
2. [Limos.com](https://www.limos.com) - Easy-to-use interface with clear service presentation.

### Colours:

- **Primary**: Blue (#0071bc) - Represents reliability and professionalism.
- **Neutral**: White (#ffffff) - Modern and clean.
- **Highlight**: Gold (#ffd700) - Adds luxury and visual interest.

### Images:

- Use the company’s logo and existing vehicle photos.
- Incorporate images of vehicles in action, customer testimonials, and scenic views for wine tours.

### Fonts:

- **Headlines**: Roboto Slab - Professional and bold.
- **Body**: Open Sans - Easy to read.
